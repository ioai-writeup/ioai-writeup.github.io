This is an unofficial IOAI writeup repo!

### Technical information

All the solution content is hosted in `all_collections/_posts`. Each task has its own dedicated page, which is written in [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Markdown codeblocks are supported, and you can use math notation within the `$$ ... $$` syntax (via MathJax).

The site uses a Jekyll and Ruby tech stack.
