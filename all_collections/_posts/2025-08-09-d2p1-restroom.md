In order to find the photos from the same restrooms, you can take a colour histogram of all the cropped and uncropped photos, and match each cropped histogram to its two closest uncropped histograms. This is because photos taken from the same restrooms would appear to have very similar colour palettes. This would reduce your match to two possible options (the uncropped Male and Female signs).

Then you can fine-tune a pretrained ResNet50 to detect whether a restroom sign is Male or Female, in order to find the sign of the opposite gender.
